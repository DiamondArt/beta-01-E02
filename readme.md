## TESTS

#### `add`
export the function `add` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the addition of those two.

#### `sub`
export the function `sub` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the substraction of those two.

#### `sign`
export the function `sign` that takes one number argument
and return 1 if the number is positive, -1 if then number is negative
and 0 if the number is exactly 0

#### `abs`
export the function `abs` that takes one number argument
and returns it's absolute value.

#### `max`
export the function `max` that returns the bigest of the two
given number arguments.

#### `min`
export the function `min` that returns the smallest of the two
given number arguments.

#### `positive`
export the function `positive` that takes two number arguments
and returns true if when multiplied they should return a positive number.

#### `multiply`
export the function `multiply` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the multiplication of those two.

#### `divide`
export the function `divide` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the division of those two.
