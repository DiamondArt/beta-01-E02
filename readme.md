## TESTS

#### `add`
export the function `add` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the addition of those two.

#### `sub`
export the function `sub` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the substraction of those two.

#### `abs`
export the function `abs` that takes one number argument
and returns it's absolute value.

#### `max`
export the function `max` that returns the bigest of the two
given number arguments.

#### `min`
export the function `min` that returns the smallest of the two
given number arguments.

#### `sign`
export the function `sign` that takes one number argument
and return 1 if the number is positive, -1 if then number is negative
and 0 if the number is exactly 0

#### `sameSign`
export the function `sameSign` that takes two number arguments
and returns true if they have the same sign.

#### `multiply`
export the function `multiply` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the multiplication of those two.

#### `modulo`
export the function `modulo` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the remainder of an [euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division) between those two, just like the [remainder operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder).

#### `divide`
export the function `divide` that takes two number arguments
and returns the result of the quotient of an [euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division) between those two.

#### `ceil`
export the function `ceil` that should work just like
[`Math.ceil`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil)

#### `floor`
export the function `floor` that should work just like
[`Math.floor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor)

export the function `round` that should work just like
[`Math.round`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round)

#### `trunc`
export the function `trunc` that should work just like
[`Math.trunc`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/trunc)

#### `odd`
export the function `odd` takes one number argument and return true if it's an odd number

#### `even`
export the function `even` that should work just like
[`Math.even`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/even)


## BONUS

#### bonus rule `no block statement`
You didn't made any blocks, only arrow functions.

#### bonus rule `no loops`
Use recursion instead of loops
